          <div>
               <p>A team of elemental-themed Magical Girls, the Pure Elements are the main protagonists of Magical Girl Raising Project: JOKERS, the seventh novel in the Magical Girl Raising Project series by Asari Endou. The Pure Elements serve as the protectors of S-City, fighting shapeshifting monsters called Disruptors who attack every night. They are overseen by a woman named Ms. Tanaka who has provided them with a training facility/base of operations/secret clubhouse.</p>
               <p>Each of the Pure Elements controls a different classical element, and all of them are capable of using a technique called Luxury Mode to access a temporary boost in power. When two or more of the Pure Elements are present, they can perform a powerful combination attack called Ultimate Princess Explosion.</p>

                    <p>The Pure Elements are artificial Magical Girls created as part of an experiment to empower people who don't have the normal magical qualifications to become Magical Girls. They require regular intake of a special medicine in order to assume their Magical Girl forms and their is a time limit to using their powers, weaknesses that are not present in regular Magical Girls. The Disruptors are merely training homunculi that pose no actual threat.</p>
                    <p>The "Princess Project" was created by Pfle, now head of the Magical Kingdom's Research & Development Department, as part of her plan to reshape the Magical Kingdom to her own desires. Ms. Tanaka is the original Lapis Lazuline, now known as Old Blue, who helped manipulate Pfle into creating the project for her own ends.</p>
                    <p>When word gets out about the artificial Magical Girls, various factions within the Magical Kingdom send agents or freelancers after the Pure Elements in order to capture or kill them. The Osk Faction, who has been experimenting with their own artificial Magical Girls, the Shufflin, in particular aim to destroy the Pure Elements while testing Shufflin's capabilities.</p>
